How to run effective meetings
=============================

This guide will help you make sure both parties:
- agree what the meeting is about
- it is clear who owns the project
- there are no hidden assumptions
- clear next steps
- clear communication commitments
- walk away with clear expectations towards each other

Clarify problem
---------------

- at the beginning of the meeting, clarify what the problem is
- do not pass over this part until you are sure you understand what the other party thinks and wants
- if the meeting is over and you do not understand what the other wants, you must
    - tell them you still don't know what they want
    - you do not own this problem
    - you will not do any work
    - clarify who sets up the next meeting, if you are willing to have another meeting

Gauge business impact
---------------------

- if you clear up what the problem is, talk about the potential product/business impact
- you have to be honest
- it's likely that the other party can explain to you why it's important, so listen
- the goal for you is to decide what the business impact is
- it's nice if the other party agrees, but they don't have to (ppl usually think their problems are the most important)
- you have to clearly state what you gauge the product/business impact is

Prioritize
----------

- based on the impact, you assign a priority to it
- you have to clearly state what priority you assign to it
- shortly explain what the other projects are that have a higher priority (to make sure the other party doesn't hate you)
- we should have a priority list

Clarify what you will do, what you will not do
----------------------------------------------

- if you agree to do something:
- define a next step
- define the ownership of the project: the owner should be to whom it's most important
- give estimates
- clearly state your estimates are not deadlines
- clarify how you will communicate:
    - it's best to agree on a set date eg. "I will update you on Friday."
    - that way, the other party gets an update whether you made progress or not
    - it's okay if you didn't make progress, you just have to say so on Friday in the email 
- the owner must be in charge of setting up a next meeting, if necessary

Finish meeting
--------------

- finish meeting by making sure there is no confusion
- re-state important things:
  - who is the owner
  - will you do something, if anything
  - what is your estimate, but it's not a deadline
  - who will write the next email, when
  - who is in charge of setting up next meeting, if there will be one

Gotchas
-------

- do not expect that the other party is good at running meetings and doing all this
- even if they are a senior manager
- you are responsible to make sure your meetings are good and clear

Showing leadership
------------------

- sometimes you have to step up
- the other party doesn't have the time/resources/attention span, even though it's important to them and not to you
- but you gauge that it's very important to the product/business
  often they can't clearly state their problem / project, because they don't even have the time to think/track it through
- in this case, showing leadership is:
  - taking ownership of the whole thing
  - spending the time with them to figure out what the thing is (set up meetings for this)
  - and so on
- this should probably only happen rarely, and with hox
